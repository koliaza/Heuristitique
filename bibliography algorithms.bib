  abstract = {{We show how to generate k-regular graphs on n vertices uniformly
	at random in expected time O(nk3), provided k = O(n1/3). The algorithm
	employs a modification of a switching argument previously used to
	count such graphs asymptotically for k = o(n1/3). The asymptotic
	formula is re-derived, using the new switching argument. The method
	is applied also to graphs with given degree sequences, provided certain
	conditions are met. In particular, it applies if the maximum degree
	is O(E(G)1/4). The method is also applied to bipartite graphs.}},
